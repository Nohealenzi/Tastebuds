App Ideas
- 
* BreathNote: A journaling app that recommends meditiations or breathwork based on your journal entries and mood selections. 
* BaseCamp: An app that connects outdoorsy people to find camping groups, share gear and knowledge, and discover new spots.
* Wander: Similar to BaseCamp, an app catered towards outdoorsy people, but in this case it's to find hiking trail companions or nature trail companions, discover new spots, and leave reviews about the hikes. Another idea could be combinig both concepts into the same app.
* Threadz: A Tinder-like swiping style app that matches clothing styles based on user preference and has a shopping section to shop for the selected items.
* TasteBuds: An app where you insert  an ingredient or list of ingredients and it shows you  a list of recepies  with the selected ingredient/s. Additional features could include a challenge section where user gets a random ingredient or select a theme and has to come up with a recepie which is then rated by the community in the app.
* BookWorm: An app for bookworms where users can share their book interests, they can also trade, lend, or gift books.

Out of all these ideas, I'd say my favorite 3 are the Bookworm app, TasteBuds, and Wander(wander would be a combination of Wander and BaseCamp). 

# BookWorm
**What:** BookWorm is an app made for people who love reading. It's main purpose is to facilitate reading.

**Who:** This app can be for people who maybe aren't so sure what kind of books to begin with or it they just want to find some free books, or maybe bookworms who want to share their knowledge and trade books with other readers.

**Why:** BookWorm's intention is to help people reconect with reading, especially with the ever-growing options of social media platforms. 

**Challenges:** Some of the challenges could include managing book trades and lending logistics. If this were an active business, another issue could be the monetization of an app like this.


# TasteBuds
**What:** TasteBuds is an app designed for cooking enthusiasts and home chefs. Its main purpose is to help users discover recipes based on the ingredients they already have, encouraging creativity and reducing food waste. Additional features include a challenge mode where users get random ingredients or select a cooking theme, create recipes, and have them rated by the community.

**Who:** This app is for foodies and anyone who wants to try new recepies. This includes people trying to minimize food waste by using up leftover ingredients, to culinary enthusiasts who enjoy cooking challenges and engaging with a food-loving community.

**Why:** TasteBuds aims to make cooking more accessible and fun with a community based approach. It encourages people to experiment in the kitchen, improve their cooking skills, and connect with others who share their passion for food. It also promotes sustainability by helping users make the most of the ingredients they already have 

**Challenges:** Some challenges for this app include a comprehensive database, which could be very challenging. Then another big one would be ensuring the proper labeling when it comes to food allergies since it could lead to serious complications. Additionally, safety could be a concern with minors handling sharp objects like knives or utilizing hot stoves.


# Wander
**What:** Wander is an app tailored for outdoorsy people. Its main purpose is to help users find hiking or nature trail companions, discover and review trails, and connect with others for camping trips. Additional features include a gear-sharing section and a knowledge exchange platform for camping tips and outdoor activities.

**Who:** This app is for new and experienced hikers and campers alike. It's for anyone who enjoys the outdoors. This includes experienced solo hikers looking for trail companions to beginners wanting guidance and knowledge from experienced outdoor enthusiasts

**Why:** Wanderâ€™s goal is to build a community of nature lovers by making outdoor adventures more accessible and enjoyable. It promotes a sense of camaraderie, helps users discover hidden gems, and encourages knowledge-sharing for safer during outdoor activities.

**Challenges:** I think that one of the main challenges and concerns for an app like this could be user safety. This includes saftey when on the trails that were reccomended through the app, safety for the users connecting with strangers, or safety as in privacy concerns when it comes to users sharing their personal location. Another challenge could be integrating reliable navigation or trail mapping tools for users to access while offline.
